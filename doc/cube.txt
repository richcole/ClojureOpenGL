p - center of the cube
r - radius of the cube

ux, uy, uz - unit vectors

faces: p, vs : permutation of(ux, uy, uz), sign
  - position fp is p + sign * r * first(vs), 
  - corners fp -+ r * first(permutation(second(vs), third(vs)))

density: p -> { 0, 1 }
draw face (p, q) if
  density(p) != density(q)

test(p, p +- one_of(ux, uy, uz))

we want faces to point outwards
this depends on the winding of the triangles

ensure winding of the faces points out
 - counter clockwise from outside the cube
   for +z
     (-x, y -> -x, -y -> x, -y)
     (x, -y -> x, y -> -x, y)
 - u, v coords come from x and y
 - how does this change for -z
