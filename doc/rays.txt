a line l is (l0 + alpha l1)
a plane p has the equation that (p . pn) = c

can get a characteristic equation for a line by having zero distance
to the projection of a point onto the line.

so (l0 + alpha l1) . (pn) = c
   alpha = (c - l0.pn) / (l1.pn)

plug back into the line

  l0 + ((c - l0.pn) / (l1.pn)) l1

then ask whether or not that points falls within the bounds of the plane.

Now for a rectangular array of cubes many of the line are in common

Conside a plane at p0 with normal U_i. The dot products contain
individual multiplies.
